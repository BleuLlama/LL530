Schematic_V100.pdf contains the full schematic for the first
version of the LL530 board released.  The schematic is v1.4
10 units were produced.

Some board modifications are necessary:

- One of the power rail vias needed to be drilled out to eliminate a short

- Resistors needed to be added to DB9 Port A (J2) as well as DB9 Port B (J17)
  so that paddle controllers can work.

  On both connectors:
	- connect a 470k ohm resistor from pin 5 to GND (pin 8)
	- connect a 470k ohm resistor from pin 9 to GND (pin 8)

  Note that Paddle controllers do not work in both ports simultaneously
  and on future versions of the board, they may only have these pulldowns
  added for Port B.

- The solder points for the DIN connector for the Amiga 2000/3000 keyboard
  are incorrect.  Either swap wires going to pins 1 and 3, and 4 and 5, or 
  mount the DIN connector on the bottom of the board.
