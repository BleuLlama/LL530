These are some tests to determine if the LL530 can read a 
CD-32 controller.

The content in CD32toUSB is directly from aminet:
	Short:        CD32 Gamepad to USB Adapter
	Author:       ylf@gmx.de (Joerg Thomas)
	Type:         docs/hard
	Version:      1.04

The content in CD32toUSB_LL530B is that code, but with the pinouts
rewrired to work on LL530 controller port B (or A, or original)
